[[bertsekas2008introduction]]
Consider an infinite sequence of trials. The probability of success at the $i$th trial is some positive number $p_{i}$. Let $N$ be the event that there is no success, and let $I$ be the event that there is an infinite number of successes

(a) If the trials are independent and $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{\infty} p_{i} = \infty$, then $\P(N) = 0$ and $\P(I) = 1$

(b) If $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{\infty} p_{i} < \infty$, then $\P(I) = 0$
