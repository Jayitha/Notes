**Nonnegativity**
$P(A) \geq 0$, for ever event $A$

**Additivity**
If $A$ and $B$ are two disjoint events, then the probability of their union satisfies
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$
More generally, if the sample space has an infinite number of elements and $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots$ is a sequence of disjoint events, then the probability of their union satisfies
$$P(A_{1} \cup A_{2} \cup \cdots) = P(A_{1}) + P(A_{2}) + \cdots$$

**Normalization**
The probability of the entire sample space $\Omega$ is equal to $1$, that is 
$$P(\Omega) = 1$$
