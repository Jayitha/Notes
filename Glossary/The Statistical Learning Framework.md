- The learner’s input
	- Domain set $\X$ - population
	- Label set $\Y$ - possible labels
	- Training data $S = ((x_{1}, y_{1}), \ldots, (x_{m}, y_{m})) \subseteq \X \times \Y$
- The learner’s output: a hypothesis: $h: \X \longrightarrow \Y$
- A data-generation model
	- Probability distribution over $\X$ is denoted by $\mathcal{D}: \X \longrightarrow [0, 1]$
	- Some correct labelling function $f: \X \longrightarrow \Y$ 
	- $S$ is generated by sampling $x_{i}$ according to $\mathcal{D}$ and labelling using $f$
- Measure of success
	- *error of a classifier* - probability that it does not predict the right answer on a random data point
	- [[Error of a Prediction Rule]]
- The learner is blind to both $\mathcal{D}$ and $f$
