Commutativity: $a \times b = b \times a$
Associativity: $a \times (b \times c) = (a \times b) \times c$
where $\times$ is a binary operator. Scalar multiplication is both commutative and associative whereas matrix multiplication is associative but not commutative
Outerjoins are commutative but not associative
