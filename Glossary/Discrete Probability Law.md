[[bertsekas2008introduction]]
If the sample space consists of a finite number of possible outcomes, then the probability law is specified by the probabilities of the events that consists of a single element. In particular, the probability of any event $\{s_{1}s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n}\}$ is the sum of the probabilities of its elements:
$$P(\{s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n}\}) = P(s_{1}) + P(s_{2}) + \cdots + P(s_{n})$$
