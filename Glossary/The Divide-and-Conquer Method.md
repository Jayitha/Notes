*The Divide-and-Conquer Method*

The probabilities $\P(B)$ of various events $B$ are obtained from conditional probabilities $\P(B|A_{i})$, where the $A_{i}$ are suitable events that form a partition of the sample space and have known probabilities $\P(A_{i})$. The probabilities $\P(B)$ are then obtained using the [[Total Probability Theorem]]
