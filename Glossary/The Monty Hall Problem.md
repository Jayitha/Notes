[[bertsekas2008introduction]]
You are told that a prize is equally likely to be found behind any one of the 3 closed doors in front of you. You point to one of the doors. A friend opens for you one of the remaining two doors, after making sure that the prize is not behind it. At this point you can stick to your initial choice, or switch to the other unopened door. Consider the following strategies

*Stick to your initial choice*

The probability of winning is $1/3$ since the prize is equally likely to be behind each door

*Switch to the other opened door*

If the prize is behind the initially chosen door ($1/3$), you do not win. Otherwise (2/3), youâ€™re guaranteed to win since your friend eliminates the door without the prize
