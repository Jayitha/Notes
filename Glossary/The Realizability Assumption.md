There exists $h^{\star}\in \H$ s.t. the true loss is zero ($\L_{\D, f}(h^{\star})= 0$). This assumption implies that with probability $1$ over all samples $S$ over $\D$, you get $L_S(h^{\star})= 0$
In the [[Empirical Risk Minimization|ERM]] case this implies there exists a hypothesis where the empirical loss is $0$
