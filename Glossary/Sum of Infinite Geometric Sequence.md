Let $a, ap, ap^{2}, ap^{3}, \ldots$ be an infinite geometric sequence with $p < 1$. Then the sum of this sequence is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{n} &= a + ap + ap^{2} + ap^{3} + \cdots \\
pS_{n} &= ap + ap^{2} + ap^{3} + ap^{4} + \cdots \\
S_{n} - pS_{n} &= a\\
S_{n} &= \frac{a}{1 - p}
\end{aligned}
$$
You can also prove this using the [[Maclaurin Series|Maclaurin Series Expansion]] of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x}$
