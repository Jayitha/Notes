A *random variable* is a real-valued function of the outcome of an experiment

A function of a random variable defines another random variable

With each random variable, you can compute statistics of interest like the *mean* or the *variance*

A random variable can be *conditioned* on another event or random variable. Furthermore, you can also define the notion of independence of random variables.
