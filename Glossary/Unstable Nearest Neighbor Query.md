[[beyer1999nearest]]
A nearest neighbor query is ==unstable== for a given $\epsilon$ if the distance from the query point to most data points is less than $(1 + \epsilon)$ times the distance from the query point to its nearest neighbor

- In many situations, for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, as dimensionality increases, the probability that a query is unstable converges to $1$
