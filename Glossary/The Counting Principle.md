[[bertsekas2008introduction]]
Consider a process that consists of $r$ stages. Suppose that
- There are $n_{1}$ possible results at the first stage
- For every possible result at the first stage, there are $n_{2}$ possible results at the second stage
- More generally, at stage $i$ there are $n_{i}$ possible results for each outcome of the previous stage
The total number of possible results of the $r$-stage process is
$$n_{1} \cdot n_{2} \cdots n_{r}$$
