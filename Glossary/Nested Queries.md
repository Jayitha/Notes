[[Unit 1 - SQL]]
SQL is *compositional* i.e. you can use subqueries. Input and outputs are relations (multisets). Subqueries can be correlated. 
Subqueries can be used in any of the following clauses: `SELECT`, `FROM` (called *derived tables*), `WHERE` (for instance, using `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`) and `HAVING`
