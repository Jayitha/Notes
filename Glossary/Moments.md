[[bertsekas2008introduction]]
The *2nd moment* of a random variable $X$ is defined as the [[Expectation]] of the random variable $X^{2}$ ($\E[X]$)

Generally, the *nth moment* is defined as $\E[X^{n}]$ i.e. the expectation of the random variable $X^{n}$

Therefore, the *1st moment* is the [[Expectation|Mean]]

You can compute the nth moment using the [[Expected Value Rule]]
$$\E[X^{n}] = \sum\limits_{x} x^{n} p_{X}(x)$$
