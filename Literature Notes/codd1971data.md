# A data base sublanguage founded on the relational calculus  
_Edgar F Codd (1971)_

> [!abstract]-
> Three principal types of language for data base manipulation are identified: the low-level, procedure-oriented (typified by the CODASYL-proposed DML), the intermediate level, algebraic (typified by the Project MAC MacAIMS language), and the high level, relational calculus-based data sublanguage, an example of which is described in this paper. The language description is informal and stresses concepts and principles. Following this, arguments are presented for the superiority of the calculus-based type of data base sub-language over the algebraic, and for the algebraic over the low-level procedural. These arguments are particularly relevant to the questions of inter-system compatibility and standardization.
