> [!abstract]-
> The scheduling of systems of periodic tasks upon multiprocessor platforms is considered. Utilization-based conditions are derived for determining whether a periodic task system meets all deadlines when scheduled using the earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm (EDF) upon a given multiprocessor platform. A new priority-driven algorithm is proposed for scheduling periodic task systems upon multiprocessor platforms: this algorithm is shown to successfully schedule some task systems for which EDF may fail to meet all deadlines.
