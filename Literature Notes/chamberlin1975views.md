> In the interest of brevity we assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of a relational data base. In particular, we assume a familiarity with the work of Codd or Boyce and Chamberlin. The examples in this paper will be drawn from a data base which describes a department store and consists of three relations: EMP(NAME, SAL, MGR, DEPT) SALES(DEPT, ITEM, VOL) LOC(DEPT, FLOOR)
