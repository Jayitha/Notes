> [!abstract]-
> Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much wasted effort. This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers. I also describe how to use this method to do a literature survey.

- Three-pass method for reading research papers
	1. The First Pass
		- Quick scan to get bird's eye view of paper
		- ==Should take upto 5-10 mins==
		- Consists of the following steps
			1. Carefully read title, abstract and introduction (and related work if writing a survey)
			2. Read section and sub-section *headings* only
			3. Skim math to see if you have the theoretical foundations
			4. Read conclusion
			5. Skim references to take stock of which ones you've read
		- After first pass you should be able to answer the *five Cs*
			1. *Category* - type of paper
			2. *Context* - related papers
			3. *Correctness*
			4. *Contributions*
			5. *Clarity*
		- If a reviewer cannot understand your paper after the first pass, it is likely to be rejected; advocates *graphical abstracts* (summarize paper with a single figure)
	2. The Second Pass
		- Read paper ignoring details like proofs
		- ==Should take upto an hour (for an exp. reader)==
		- Jot down key points
		- Note down terms you don't understand
		- Note down questions you might want to ask the author
		- If you're reviewing, pay special attention to the figures, diagrams, illustrations and plots
			- Make sure conclusions are drawn from statistically significant plots
		- Mark unread references for future reading
	1. The Third Pass
		- Attempt to *virtually re-implement* the paper
		- ==Can take many hours for a beginner and 2 or more for an exp. reader==
		- By re-creating the work you may better understand where the work fails and if invalid (or implicit) assumptions were made
		- Challenge every assumption in every statement
		- Jot down ideas for future work
		- You should be able to reconstruct the entire paper from memory and identify weak and strong points
		- You should also be able to point out missing citations and issues with experimental and analytical content
- Literature Survey
	1. Use GoogleScholar and some key words to find 5 *recent highly-cited* papers
	2. Do the first pass over these papers and the related work section
	3. If a survey exists, read the survey
	4. Else, find shared citations and repeated authors. Track down important conferences and journals
	5. Go through these venues to find high quality related work
	6. Make two passes through these papers, generating the first version of your survey
	7. Identify unread key papers from set and iterate as necessary
