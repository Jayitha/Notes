> [!abstract]-
> We propose a federated edge-computing architecture for management of data. Our vision is to enable a service provider model for "data-services", where a user can enter into economic agreements with an infrastructure maintainer to provide storage and communication of data, without necessarily trusting the infrastructure provider. Toward this vision, we present cryptographically hardened cohesive collections of data items called DataCapsules, and an overview of the underlying federated architecture, called Global Data Plane.
