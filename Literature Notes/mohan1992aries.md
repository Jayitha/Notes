ARIES is applicable not only to database management systems but also to persistent object-oriented languages, recoverable file systems and transaction-based operating systems. ARIES has been implemented, to varying degrees, in IBM's OS/2TM Extended Edition Database Manager, DB2, Workstation Data Save Facility/VM, Starburst and QuickSilver, and in the University of Wisconsin's EXODUS and Gamma database machine.
