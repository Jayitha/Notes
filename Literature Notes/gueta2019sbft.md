> SBFT is a state of the art Byzantine fault tolerant state machine replication system that addresses the challenges of scalability, decentralization and global geo-replication. SBFT is optimized for decentralization and is experimentally evaluated on a deployment of more than 200 active replicas withstanding a malicious adversary controlling f=64 replicas. Our experiments show how the different algorithmic ingredients of SBFT contribute to its performance and scalability. The results show that SBFT simultaneously provides almost 2x better throughput and about 1.5x better latency relative to a highly optimized system that implements the PBFT protocol. To achieve this performance improvement, SBFT uses a combination of four ingredients: using collectors and threshold signatures to reduce communication to linear, using an optimistic fast path, reducing client communication and utilizing redundant servers for the fast path. SBFT is the first system to implement a correct dual-mode view change protocol that allows to efficiently run either an optimistic fast path or a fallback slow path without incurring a view change to switch between modes.
