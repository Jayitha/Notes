# Implementing constant-bandwidth servers upon multiprocessor platforms

> [!abstract]-
> In constant-bandwidth server (CBS) systems, several different applications are executed upon a shared computing platform in such a manner that each application seems to be executing on a slower dedicated processor. CBS systems have thus far only been implemented upon uniprocessors; here, a multiprocessor extension, which can be implemented upon computing platforms comprised of several identical preemptable processors, is proposed and proven correct.
