> A number of recent studies have examined the performance of concurrency control algorithms for database management systems. The results reported to date, rather than being definitive, have tended to be contradictory. In this paper, rather than presenting “yet another algorithm performance study,” we critically investigate the assumptions made in the models used in past studies and their implications. We employ a fairly complete model of a database environment for studying the relative performance of three different approaches to the concurrency control problem under a variety of modeling assumptions. The three approaches studied represent different extremes in how transaction conflicts are dealt with, and the assumptions addressed pertain to the nature of the database system's resources, how transaction restarts are modeled, and the amount of information available to the concurrency control algorithm about transactions' reference strings. We show that differences in the underlying assumptions explain the seemingly contradictory performance results. We also address the question of how realistic the various assumptions are for actual database systems.
