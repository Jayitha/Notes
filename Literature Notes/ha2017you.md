> M handoff enables rapid and transparent placement changes to executing code in edge computing use cases where the safety and management attributes of VM encapsulation are important. This versatile primitive offers the functionality of classic live migration but is highly optimized for the edge. Over WAN bandwidths ranging from 5 to 25 Mbps, VM handoff migrates a running 8 GB VM in about a minute, with a downtime of a few tens of seconds. By dynamically adapting to varying network bandwidth and processing load, VM handoff is more than an order of magnitude faster than live migration at those bandwidths.
