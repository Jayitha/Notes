> We present Tapestry, a peer-to-peer overlay routing infrastructure offering efficient, scalable, location-independent routing of messages directly to nearby copies of an object or service using only localized resources. Tapestry supports a generic decentralized object location and routing applications programming interface using a self-repairing, soft-state-based routing layer. The paper presents the Tapestry architecture, algorithms, and implementation. It explores the behavior of a Tapestry deployment on PlanetLab, a global testbed of approximately 100 machines. Experimental results show that Tapestry exhibits stable behavior and performance as an overlay, despite the instability of the underlying network layers. Several widely distributed applications have been implemented on Tapestry, illustrating its utility as a deployment infrastructure.
