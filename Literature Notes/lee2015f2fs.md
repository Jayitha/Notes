> F2FS is a Linux file system designed to perform well on modern flash storage devices. The file system builds on append-only logging and its key design decisions were made with the characteristics of flash storage in mind. This paper describes the main design ideas, data structures, algorithms and the resulting performance of F2FS. Experimental results highlight the desirable performance of F2FS; on a state-of-the-art mobile system, it outperforms EXT4 under synthetic workloads by up to 3.1 (iozone) and 2 (SQLite). It reduces elapsed time of several realistic workloads by up to 40%. On a server system, F2FS is shown to perform better than EXT4 by up to 2.5 (SATA SSD) and 1.8 (PCIe SSD).
