> We present QueryViz, a novel visualization tool for SQL queries that reduces the time needed to read and understand existing queries. It targets two principal audiences: (i) users who often issue the same or similar queries and who need to quickly browse through a repository of existing queries; and (ii) novices that try to familiarize themselves with the logic behind alternative patterns of SQL queries. QueryViz uses as input only two strings: the database schema and the SQL query. It can thus serve as light-weight add-on to existing database systems and is also available via an online interface at http://queryviz.com. In this demonstration, we explain our visual alphabet, walk through the visualization algorithm, and let users experience the difference in understanding SQL queries from text or our graphical representation while browsing through repositories of well-known textbook SQL queries.
