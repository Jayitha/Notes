_Eric Brewer (2012)_

> [!abstract]-
> The CAP theorem asserts that any networked shared-data system can have only two of three desirable properties. However, by explicitly handling partitions, designers can optimize consistency and availability, thereby achieving some trade-off of all three. The featured Web extra is a podcast from Software Engineering Radio, in which the host interviews Dwight Merriman about the emerging NoSQL movement, the three types of nonrelational data stores, Brewer's CAP theorem, and much more.
