# SEQUEL: A structured english query language  
_Donald D Chamberlin, Raymond F Boyce (1974)_

Tags: `=join(this.file.tags, " ")`

> [!abstract]-
> In this paper we present the data manipulation facility for a structured English query language (SEQUEL) which can be used for accessing data in an integrated relational data base. Without resorting to the concepts of bound variables and quantifiers SEQUEL identifies a set of simple operations on tabular structures, which can be shown to be of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus. A SEQUEL user is presented with a consistent set of keyword English templates which reflect how people use tables to obtain information. Moreover, the SEQUEL user is able to compose these basic templates in a structured manner in order to form more complex queries. SEQUEL is intended as a data base sublanguage for both the professional programmer and the more infrequent data base user.
