data-href=\"#Wolfgang-Gatterbauer\">#Wolfgang-Gatterbauer</a><br>Abstract\nWe present QueryViz, a novel visualization tool for SQL queries that reduces the time needed to read and understand existing queries. It targets two principal audiences: (i) users who often issue the same or similar queries and who need to quickly browse through a repository of existing queries; and (ii) novices that try to familiarize themselves with the logic behind alternative patterns of SQL queries. QueryViz uses as input only two strings: the database schema and the SQL query. It can thus serve as light-weight add-on to existing database systems and is also available via an online interface at <a rel=\"noopener\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://queryviz.com.\" target=\"_self\">http://queryviz.com.</a> In this demonstration, we explain our visual alphabet, walk through the visualization algorithm, and let users experience the difference in understanding SQL queries from text or our graphical representation while browsing through repositories of well-known textbook SQL queries.\n<br>Dataview: No results to show for list query.","aliases":"QueryViz: Helping users understand SQL queries and their patterns","tags":["t","o","-","r","e","a","d",","," ","J","o","n","a","t","h","a","n","-","D","a","n","a","p","a","r","a","m","i","t","a",","," ","W","o","l","f","g","a","n","g","-","G","a","t","t","e","r","b","a","u","e","r"],"headers":[{"heading":"QueryViz: Helping users understand SQL queries and their patterns","level":1,"id":"<span class=\"dataview dataview-inline-query\"><span>QueryViz: Helping users understand SQL queries and their patterns</span></span>"},{"heading":"References","level":2,"id":"References"}],"backlinks":["streams/wolfgang-gatterbauer's-cs-7240-principles-of-scalable-data-management/topic-1-data-models-and-query-languages/unit-1-sql.html"],"links":["?query=tag:to-read","?query=tag:Jonathan-Danaparamita","?query=tag:Wolfgang-Gatterbauer","http://queryviz.com."],"author":"Jayitha Cherapanamjeri","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://jayitha.github.io/Notes/literature-notes/danaparamita2011queryviz.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1711136297409,"modifiedTime":1711136308606,"sourceSize":1482,"sourcePath":"Literature Notes/danaparamita2011queryviz.md","exportPath":"literature-notes/danaparamita2011queryviz.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"literature-notes/elmasri2016fundamentals.html":{"title":"<span class=\"dataview dataview-inline-query\"><span>Fundamentals of database systems 7th ed.</span></span>","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-file\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M14.5 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7.5L14.5 2z\"></path><polyline points=\"14 2 14 8 20 8\"></polyline></svg>","description":"<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://jayitha.github.io/Notes/?query=tag:t\" style=\"background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116);

Less well understood is how to compare relational languages by their ability to represent relational query patterns. Indeed, what are query patterns other than \"a certain way of writing a query\"? And how can query patterns be defined across procedural and declarative languages, irrespective of their syntax? To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first semantic definition of relational query patterns by using a variant of structure-preserving mappings between the relational tables of queries. This formalism allows us to analyze the relative pattern expressiveness of relational language fragments and create a hierarchy of languages with equal logical expressiveness yet different pattern expressiveness. Notably, for the non-disjunctive language fragment, we show that relational calculus can express a larger class of patterns than the basic operators of relational algebra. Our language-independent definition of query patterns opens novel paths for assisting database users. For example, these patterns could be leveraged to create visual query representations that faithfully represent query patterns, speed up interpretation, and provide visual feedback during query editing. As a concrete example, we propose Relational Diagrams, a complete and sound diagrammatic representation of safe relational calculus that is provably (i) unambiguous, (ii) relationally complete, and (iii) able to represent all query patterns for unions of non-disjunctive queries. Among all diagrammatic representations for relational queries that we are aware of, ours is the only one with these three properties. Furthermore, our anonymously preregistered user study shows that Relational Diagrams allow users to recognize patterns meaningfully faster and more accurately than SQL.\n<br>Dataview: No results to show for list query.","aliases":"On the reasonable effectiveness of relational diagrams: Explaining relational query patterns and the pattern expressiveness of relational languages","tags":["t","o","-","r","e","a","d",","," ","W","o","l","f","g","a","n","g","-","G","a","t","t","e","r","b","a","u","e","r",","," ","C","o","d","y","-","D","u","n","n","e"],"headers":[{"heading":"On the reasonable effectiveness of relational diagrams: Explaining relational query patterns and the pattern expressiveness of relational languages","level":1,"id":"<span class=\"dataview dataview-inline-query\"><span>On the reasonable effectiveness of relational diagrams: Explaining relational query patterns and the pattern expressiveness of relational languages</span></span>"},{"heading":"References","level":2,"id":"References"}],"backlinks":["streams/wolfgang-gatterbauer's-cs-7240-principles-of-scalable-data-management/topic-1-data-models-and-query-languages/unit-1-sql.html"],"links":["?query=tag:to-read","?query=tag:Wolfgang-Gatterbauer","?query=tag:Cody-Dunne"],"author":"Jayitha Cherapanamjeri","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://jayitha.github.io/Notes/literature-notes/gatterbauer2024reasonable.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1711134410236,"modifiedTime":1711134413445,"sourceSize":2565,"sourcePath":"Literature Notes/gatterbauer2024reasonable.md","exportPath":"literature-notes/gatterbauer2024reasonable.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"literature-notes/ramakrishnan2002database.html":{"title":"<span class=\"dataview dataview-inline-query\"><span>Database management systems</span></span>","icon":"<svg class=\"svg-icon lucide-file\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M14.5 2H6a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h12a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7.5L14.5 2z\"></path><polyline points=\"14 2 14 8 20 8\"></polyline></svg>","description":"<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://jayitha.github.io/Notes/?query=tag:t\" style=\"background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116);

Since computing probabilities for query answers is <a href=\"https://jayitha.github.io/Notes?query=tag:P-hard\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"#P-hard\">#P-hard</a>, even for fairly simple conjunctive queries, both the PDB and SRL communities have proposed a number of approximation techniques over the years. The two prevalent techniques are either (i) MCMC-style sampling or (ii) branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) algorithms that iteratively improve model-based bounds using a combination of variable substitution and elimination. We propose a new anytime B&amp;B approximation scheme that encompasses all prior model-based approximation schemes proposed in the PDB and SRL literature. Our approach relies on the novel idea of \"scaled dissociation\" which can improve both the upper and lower bounds of existing modelbased algorithms. We apply our approach to the well-studied problem of evaluating self-join-free conjunctive queries over tuple-independent PDBs, and show a consistent reduction in approximation error in our experiments on TPC-H, Yago3, and a synthetic benchmark setting.\n<br>Dataview: No results to show for list query.","aliases":"Anytime approximation in probabilistic databases via scaled
